    "We use `numpy.linalg.solve` (hereafter referred to as `solve`) for solving dense linear system, and `scipy.sparse.linalg.spsolve` (hereafter referred to as `spsolve`) for solving sparse linear system. It is found that under the same $n$, `spsolve` is much faster than `solve`. Moreover, as $n$ increases, the time required by `solve` grows super-linearly, whereas the increase for spsolve is sub-linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of estimating memory occupation during LU decomposition, distinct methods are applied to `solve` and `spsolve`. In the case of `solve`, where matrix $A$ is dense, the decomposition process involves storing three $n\\times n$ matrices in memory. Therefore, we use the total number of entries in the dense matrices $\\bm{A}$, $\\bm{L}$, and $\\bm{U}$, which amounts to $3n^2$, as an indicator of the memory used by `solve`. Conversely, for `spsolve`, where $\\bm{A}$ is a sparse matrix, only the non-zero entries are stored. Given that the number of non-zero entries in $\\bm{A}$ is considerably fewer than those in $\\bm{L}$ and $\\bm{U}$, we consider the total number of non-zero elements in $\\bm{L}$ and $\\bm{U}$ as an indicator of the memory used by `spsolve`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the results of the code run show, `solve` takes up far less memory than `spsolve`. Moreover, as $n$ increases by a factor of 10, the memory occupied by `solve` grows by a factor of $10^2 = 100$, while the memory occupied by `solve` grows linearly."

    "The relative difference derived from both the 1-norm and infinity norm are significantly lower than the anticipated level of accuracy. Herein, the 1-norm accumulates all the differences, whereas the infinity norm focuses solely on the largest discrepancy. Consequently, these discrepancies are negligible and can be disregarded in the context of this analysis."
